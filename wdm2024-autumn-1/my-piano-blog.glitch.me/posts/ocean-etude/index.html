    <h1 class='postTitle'>Ocean etude</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>By Oxford dictionary etude is &quot;a short musical composition, typically for one instrument, designed as an exercise to improve the technique or demonstrate the skill of the player&quot; and this most defenetly is that - a really difficult piece that really develops a certain piano playing skill - in the case of this piece, it is fast arpeggios.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn one of Chopins etudes for a long time, but I am honestly not so sure as to why this piece pulled me in so hard, or why I even initially chose to begin with, but I remember working really hard to get this piece into my fingers. I studied this piece for around about 4-5 months from January 2022 - June 2022, then I actually played this piece at my schools graduation, where 1 grade younger than me finished high school.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Composed by Frédéric Chopin in 1836, the Étude Op. 25 No. 12, often referred to as the &quot;Ocean Etude&quot;, is the final piece in his second set of études. This piece is a showcase of Chopin's mastery of both technical brilliance and expressive power, earning its nickname due to the powerful, wave-like arpeggios that flow throughout the piece, resembling the relentless motion of the ocean.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ocean Etude&quot; is one of Chopin's most demanding études, requiring exceptional finger strength, endurance, and fluidity. Its sweeping, dramatic nature reflects Chopin’s ability to combine virtuosic technique with deep emotional expression, as the continuous arpeggios move across the keyboard like waves crashing in a storm. As a part of his Op. 25 collection, this piece solidified Chopin's reputation not only as a brilliant composer but also as a revolutionary figure in piano technique during the Romantic era.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 9.5/10 - Despite being an etude, the musicality Chopin managers to gring out from all of these arpeggios is insane.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 9/10 - Chopins etudes are all so hard pieces, and this one is no exeption.</p>
<p>Practising - 8/10 - Practising any etude can be quite repetetive, but fun. This one especially is pretty repetitive, but a real challenge. The repetition actually really helps you to get the techinque under your fingers.</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 9.5/10 - As are all Chopins etudes, they are quite easy to remeber, sadly since it is so difficult you need so much warmup to make sure you don't injure your hands.</p>
<h4>Performance (not mine)</h4>
