    <h1 class='postTitle'>Clair de Lune</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>I started learning this piece while I was in university since I wanted some easy piece to spent half an hours every couple of days on. Turned out it wasn't as simple as that, it took me little over 3 months from September - Decemeber 2023 to actually finish it. The piece is just very long and quite hard to remeber, but in the end the piece is extremly beautiful and was worth learning.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>&quot;Clair de Lune&quot; (French for &quot;Moonlight&quot;) is the third and most famous movement from Claude Debussy's Suite Bergamasque, composed between 1890 and 1905. The piece is one of the most beloved works in the classical piano repertoire and is an iconic example of Impressionist music, though Debussy himself resisted the label.</p>
<p>Inspired by Paul Verlaine's poem of the same name, &quot;Clair de Lune&quot; evokes a serene, dreamlike atmosphere, with its flowing, lyrical melody and gentle harmonies. Written in D-flat major, the piece is known for its subtle shifts in dynamics and tone, creating an ethereal soundscape that suggests the calm beauty of moonlight reflecting on water or a tranquil evening sky.</p>
<p>Though it begins softly and delicately, &quot;Clair de Lune&quot; builds to a rich, emotional climax before returning to its original calm, reflective mood. Its poetic nature and fluidity make it a perfect example of Debussyâ€™s talent for painting vivid musical images, requiring the pianist to focus on expressiveness and touch rather than pure technical prowess.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 9.5/10 - One of the most beautiful pieces writen for piano and in my opinion Debussy's finest work.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 5.5/10 - Has some difficult sections, but nothing hand breaking.</p>
<p>Practising - 7/10 - Theres quite a lot of notes which makes the progress slow, but since most of the sections are quite easy to play progress is fast.</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 2.5/10 - The piece is long, quite easy and has a lot of repeating parts, which makes the piece quite boring to play once the wonder of the piece wears out.</p>
