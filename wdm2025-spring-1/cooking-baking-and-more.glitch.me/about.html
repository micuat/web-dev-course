    <h1>Little bit about me</h1>
    <h2>And ofc about this blog</h2>
    <p>Hey!<br> Welcome to my blog, where I share one of my biggest passions – cooking. <br>Besides making delicious food, I’m also into athletics, which is one of the reasons why high-quality, nutritious meals are so important to me.<br> Since I have a huuuge sweet tooth, I’m always looking for alternatives to store-bought candy. <br>For me, cakes and homemade baked goods are a ‘healthier’ substitute for gummy candies and other sweets. <br> Baking isn’t just a hobby; it’s a way to enjoy treats in a more balanced way while still satisfying my cravings! <br> I caught the baking bug at a young age, making all kinds of treats with my grandmother—like apple pie, 'kirju koer,' and 'Kass Artur.'<br> However, I only got into cooking savory dishes later in life. <br>I started experimenting with different recipes even more after moving out on my own.</p>
