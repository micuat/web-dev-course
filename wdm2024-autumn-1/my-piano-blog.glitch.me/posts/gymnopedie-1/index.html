    <h1 class='postTitle'>Gymnopedie no1</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>This is the first piano piece I have ever learned. The entire piece took me somewhere around a month from mid November 2020 to mid December 2020 to finish.</p>
<p>This piece is usually in a lot of lists about beginner pieces and for a good reason. It is very beautiful and yet very simple to play.
It is most defenetly a begginner piece, but if I could go back in time I would study Minuet in G first as this piece defenetly has some difficult chords for begginner in the left hand.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Composed in 1888 by Erik Satie, the piece is the first in a series of three &quot;Gymnopédies&quot; that share a similar atmosphere. &quot;Gymnopédie No. 1&quot; stands out for its slow, waltz-like tempo and its sense of calm and melancholy. Satie was part of a movement of French composers who broke away from the complexity of Romantic music, opting instead for more minimal and accessible works, and &quot;Gymnopédie No. 1&quot; perfectly captures this ethos.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 6/10 - This piece is perfect to put on in the background, but for me it's to simple to enjoy alone.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 1.5/10 - This is defenetly one of the easiest classical pieces to learn, but those chords in the left hand can be tricky.</p>
<p>Practising - 5.5/10 - I honestly don't remeber much about the learing process of the piece, so it must have been middle of the road.</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 3/10 - This piece is quite simple and once you've played it a ton, it wont be as special to play it anymore. The piece is quite easy to remeber, but there is an entire section repetition with just different endings which can make the endings hard to remeber.</p>
<h4>Performance (not mine)</h4>
