                    <h1>Greetings!</h1>
                    <h3>And welcome to my small blog!</h3>
                    <p>My name is Mary, I am 20 years old computer science student and
                        I've been trying to teach myself to draw for almost half of my life, ever since I was around 12
                        years old.<br>
                        Even though I was able to achive something in this field I still do not really consider myself
                        as a
                        <strong>real artist</strong>, because most of what I do
                        is
                        just redrawing things. Especially my favorite character from different franchises. <br>
                        <br>
                        I made this website to gather all my drawings in one place and track my progress.<br>
                        Eventually, I‚Äôd like to add a blog or diary to reflect on my art journey and of course add some
                        additional basic functions(e.g some kind of search engine, comparison tool, zoom etc).
                    </p>

                <img src="drawings/gale.png" alt="Gale Dekarious">
            </div>
            <h2>Tools and materials</h2>
            <p><a href="pinterest.html">Pinterest</a> - maybe not the best, but definitely one of the easiest tools to
                find references and inspiration</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/GX3Ax1">Asaro head</a> and <a href="https://skfb.ly/6ToJH">3D
                    body model</a> -
                both help me with shading</p>
            <p><a href="https://forums.cubebrush.co/t/male-anatomy-reference/3346">Male anatomy model</a> - useful with
                perspective for different muscles</p>
            <p><a href="https://x6ud.github.io/pose-search/#/">Pose search engine</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU75oVnCaEA&amp;list=PLkJJd8rJILPxD_IGYd63TrIfMSPSDDLmx">Playlist
                    with tutorials</a> - it may have some similiar videos, but all together they help get even more
                deeper in some themes</p>
            <p>Also, I have a skull thingy on my desk, I use it frequiently to study head perspective (at least try to)
            </p>
            <h2>Where to find me</h2>
            <p>Nowhere ü§°üëç</p>
            <h2>Note for Naoto</h2>
            <p> First of all, I want to apologize for the late submission. Unfortunately, I had a LOT less time to work
                on this website than I expected - especially since I decided to make it out of scratch. <br>
                I still have many ideas I want to implement here, and I hope I‚Äôll get to them someday.<br>
                But anyways, thank you for this course, I really enjoyed it! And have a great summer!<br>
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem;">
                P.s Btw the "add drawing" function isn't working properly at the moment due to some PHP issues with TLU
                servers so I turned it off ü´°
