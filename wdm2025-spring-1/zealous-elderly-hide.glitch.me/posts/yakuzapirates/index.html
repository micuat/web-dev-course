<!-- ![Majima](https://cdn.glitch.global/c8151369-9659-43ad-9d99-d3ff323890f0/majimapirate.png?v=1740737569695)-->
<h3>quick recap</h3>
<p>Our favorite one-eyed yakuza man somehow appears on random island near Hawaii with amnesia. Little boy Noah with his cat Goro saves him from dehydration and possible sunstroke.
After that Majima finds himself in a fight (as usual) with random pirates that for some reason still exist in 2024, beats them up, takes their ship, becomes captain
and goes on adventure, finding crew members along the way with the aim to show Noah the whole world (or atleast what he can, before returning back to Japan).</p>
<h3>first impression</h3>
<p>idk
this game came out yesterday, I've played only for like 2 hours. üíÄ But yeah, those 2 hours were
absolutely amazing. I never even realised how much I craved for traditional Yakuza fighting system.
Looks like Ichiban did me dirty, but at the same time he helped me enjoy beating up people much more
then I used to when I played Yakuza 0-6.</p>
<!-- 
Also, I've actually never played any other pirate themed games, besides Lego Pirate of the Carribean,
 therefore I can't really tell if Ryu Ga Gotoku team managed to make new Black Flag or smth like that. But it does feel 
 kinda weird to take a board pirate ship and them a few minutes later take a selfie with Goromi 
 filter(check the pic below(yes it applies on Goro cat too)). -->
<p>Honestly, I have no idea what to expect from this game. Idk if it is supposed to be a serious story like all other Yakuza games are or is it just goofy ahh game with goofy ahh character ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. <!--I just 
hope he's gonna meet Makoto ü•≤.--> Still, I kinda want it to be deeper, in a way that explains and expands Majima's character even more, because even though he is a main character<br>
in Yakuza 0 and all time fan(perhaps even devs) favorite character in whole Yakuza universe, he does not have a lot of screen time in next games, even in if the whole story
of it is about <strong>Majima himself</strong> (yes, Yakuza 4-5, I'm looking at you ü§®).</p>
<h3>aftermath</h3>
<p>I've completed game yesterday at 4am and I'am not sure how I feel about all what I've seen. I did enjoyed playing this game,
but story was too small for me, only 5 chapters. I understand that this game is more like spin-off about, but it does not help.</p>
<!-- Like, we finally have an apportunity to be Mad Dog of Shimano again since Yakuza 2 small dlc, -->
<p>Throughout whole game I wasn't sure what to expect, I was prepeared for goofy story, but at the same time part of me was hoping for a
heartbraking drama with jokes about man, who tries to understand himself again, which in the end brings some sort of
inner conflinct amid Mad Dog and Captain Majima.
Turns out, this is in fact a silly game with mediocre Disney-like story. Bad guys are being bad because they are bad, getting punished for
being bad. Good guys are being good guys, saving people and beating bad guys. Oh, and Noah is just average Naruto-like kid, I do not care about
him at all.</p>
<p>Still, I really enjoyed every second of my playthrough. It really does feel like devs were enjoying making this game too, they included
pb <strong>everything</strong> that was ever related to Majima. Every costume, every karaoke song, almost every main and sub-mission character in
Majima's life, all had it appearence in this game. Incredible.</p>
<p>All in all, I can recommend this game even for those, who have no idea about Yakuza  series, even though it is better to play it after
completing previous games.</p>
