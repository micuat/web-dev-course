<p>Also during the Open Farm Days 2024 I had the pleasure of visiting a hobby farm that had lots of cute animals, local food and products for sale and live music!</p>
<h2>Lõuka hobby farm</h2>
<p>Lõuka hobby farm or Lõuka hobitalu, in estonian, is a farm near Haapsalu, you can find them on Facebook.</p>
<h2>My experience</h2>
<p>At first we were greeted by a baby pony and it's mom in an enclosure where you could go in and meet them up close! They were both a little stressed from all the people but fortunately they didn't seem that uncomfortable and still came and said hello to the new people.</p>

<p>Next we decided to check out the bunnies who were all huddled together in a group in the shade, since it was a pretty hot day. They were quite lazy but some were curious enough to come and sniff us and eat the carrots we gave them, one even decided to take a nap in my shade!</p>

<h2>Would I recommend?</h2>
<p>This hobby-farm was one of the best ones I have been to! I saw so many cute animals and I will hopefully have a chance to go back someday:)</p>
