<h2><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</h2>
<h4>Penguin is a 2024 TV Mini Series developed by WB as a sequel to Batman(2022). The show is starring a high regarded ensemble of high regarded actors, with two main stars Colin Farell and Cristin Millioti. Still released, the show already received high acclaim for acting, visuals and engaging narrative. Story follows Oswald “Penguin” Cobb, a lieutenant in the Falcone mafia family that fights for his piece of power.</h4>

<h4>After I found out about the sequel to Batman movie as a show I was not really excited as the movie did not really catch me. But I was really surprised after the first episode, and for now even consider it to be better. The story is this old down to earth gangster drama that does not slow down too much or rush into action. it is very well paced. As the show kept visual design from the movie it only somehow elevates Penguin. and there are no more 5 minute black screen sequences. Actors are amazing. Colin Farell acts on a highest level as usual, only now wearing a heavy fat suit, that only elevates his performance by how much physicality he adds to his character. And Cristin Millioti is amazing as psychic murderer, a role that is very unique to her as she usually starred in comedies and romance movies. It was unexpectedly pleasing to see this side of her talent.</h4>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h4>Overall, <em>Penguin</em> is a captivating show that deserves its place on your watchlist. Don't miss it!</h4>
