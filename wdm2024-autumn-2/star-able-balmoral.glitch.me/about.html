        <p>Hello! I'm Marina, a passionate cake artist. I baked my first cake at 9, the day before my birthday, after my mom couldn’t make one as planned. It was a sponge cake with buttercream, and my parents were pleasantly surprised. From then on, I experimented with different recipes and started taking orders from friends, eventually gaining clients. I’ve taken several online courses and plan to attend in-person training to keep improving and evolving my skills. 
        
          </p>
        <p> I believe that desserts should not only taste amazing but also leave a lasting impression through their visual appeal. Whether it's a wedding, birthday, or any special occasion, I strive to make each creation a memorable centerpiece that reflects the unique vision of my clients. Each cake is crafted with love, care, and the finest ingredients.  </p>
