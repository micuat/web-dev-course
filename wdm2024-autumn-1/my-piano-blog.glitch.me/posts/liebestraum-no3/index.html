    <h1 class='postTitle'>Liebestraum no3</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>This piece is a special one. I learned this piece in August 2022 and in September 2024 (when I made this post) I'm still able to play the piece in its entirety. The piece starts quite slow, but picks up the pace - which means that this piece has its own natural warmup period and the fast sections make this piece not boring to play. It is also absolutly beautiful.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>&quot;Liebestraum No. 3&quot;, or &quot;Dream of Love&quot;, is one of Franz Liszt's most famous and beloved piano works. Composed in 1850, it is the third piece in a set of three Liebesträume (German for “Dreams of Love”), each of which reflects a different kind of love. Liebestraum No. 3 represents mature, unconditional love, inspired by a poem that speaks of love enduring even beyond death.</p>
<p>The piece opens with a gentle, flowing melody, set in A-flat major, that evolves into more passionate and complex sections, showcasing Liszt's genius in combining lyrical beauty with virtuosic piano technique. The melody undergoes several variations, becoming more intense as the piece progresses, with delicate arpeggios and rich harmonies that demand expressive control and technical skill.</p>
<p>Known for its sweeping romanticism, Liebestraum No. 3 exemplifies Liszt’s ability to evoke deep emotion while also offering a grand showcase for the pianist’s technical abilities. The interplay between serene lyricism and dramatic intensity has made this piece a favorite in both concert performances and as a piece to study for those seeking to master Romantic-era piano music.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 9.5/10 - One of the best pices out there, I recommend for everyone to atleast listen to it.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 8/10 - This is quite an advanced piece</p>
<p>Practising - 10/10 - Lot of notes, but they are connected to each other briliantly (for example mid section has a part where right hand has jumps with a chromatic scale to acompany it, really helps the player know what note comes next)</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 10/10 - This piece has a slow start to warm yourself up, an amazing middle section which makes it not boring to play and similarities, but no repetition - considering all of those this is in my opinion one of the best if not the best pieces to play.</p>
