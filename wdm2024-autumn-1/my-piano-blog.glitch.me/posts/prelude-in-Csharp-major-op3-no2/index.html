    <p>I really shouldnt have started learning this piece so soon. This piece is quite advanced and at the time I started to learn it I had been playing piano for about 2-3 months. But I really liked the piece and couldn't ignore it. I was quite scard to start learing this piece, but I just couldn't study other pieces this one just kept calling for me. Started somewhere around February 2022 and got the hang of the full piece around June 2022. I still know how to play the majority of the piece and it is still one of my favorites.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff in 1892 when he was only 19 years old, the Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3 No. 2 is one of his most famous and dramatic works for solo piano. Often simply referred to as the &quot;Rachmaninoff Prelude&quot;, it was part of a set titled Morceaux de Fantaisie and became an instant success after its premiere. This piece is known for its bold, thunderous opening chords, contrasted by a delicate, lyrical middle section before returning to its intense, powerful conclusion.</p>
<p>The preludeâ€™s dark and brooding atmosphere, coupled with its virtuosic demands, is a hallmark of Rachmaninoff's style. Despite its popularity, Rachmaninoff reportedly grew tired of performing the piece in public, as it was constantly requested by audiences throughout his career. Nonetheless, it remains one of the great masterpieces of the late-Romantic piano repertoire, showcasing Rachmaninoff's genius for melody, emotion, and technical brilliance.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 9.5/10 - I heard this piece at first from a random youtube recommendation and even tho the piece is quite advanced and I had been playing piano for only a few months, it sounded too good to not learn.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 7/10 - The beggining and ending sections aren't as difficult as they seem - as your muscle memory can really carry you through those parts, however the middle section is a real killer.</p>
<p>Practising - 9.5/10 - One of the best pieces to practise in my opinion. Sections have similarities, but no major repetition.</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 10/10 - I have gone months with out playing this piece, but still being able to play (at least most of it) when I want to. Could also be I spent such a long time on this piece that it is permanently engraved in my hands.</p>
