    <h1 class='postTitle'>Butterfly etude</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>This etude is the last piece I learned before starting my bachleors degree. I wanted a real challenge and having finished ocean etude a few monthes before I thougth this would be the perfect challenge. It took me about a month in August 2023 of everyday couple hours of playing to be okay at it, which is pretty crazy considering when played at full tempo it is less than a minute long. In the end I never managed to reach the full tempo this piece wants (usually being able to play with few mistaks in 1 min 30 sec), because my time was occupied wih university work.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The Étude Op. 25 No. 9, commonly known as the &quot;Butterfly Etude,&quot; was composed by Frédéric Chopin in 1834 as part of his second set of études, Op. 25. This lively and lighthearted étude is characterized by its rapid, fluttering right-hand passages that mimic the delicate flight of a butterfly, hence its popular nickname.</p>
<p>Written in G-flat major, the &quot;Butterfly Etude&quot; is relatively short but highly expressive, showcasing Chopin's ability to blend technical brilliance with poetic grace. The piece’s staccato arpeggios and light, quick movements create a playful, almost whimsical atmosphere, requiring a pianist to maintain a sense of elegance while navigating the intricate runs and dynamic contrasts.</p>
<p>Although less dramatic than some of Chopin’s other études, it still demands finger dexterity, precision, and a delicate touch, particularly in the light, fluttering passages. The &quot;Butterfly Etude&quot; is a delightful example of Chopin’s mastery of the miniature form, combining technical study with musical expression in a way that has captivated pianists and audiences alike for generations.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 9/10 - Music is so beautiful, light and happy.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 9/10 - Chopins etudes are all such hard pieces, and this one is no exeption.</p>
<p>Practising - 10/10 - Practising any etude can be quite repetetive, but fun. This one is actually on of the least repetitive ones out there, therefore also one of the more fun ones.</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 9.5/10 - As are all Chopins etudes, they are quite easy to remeber, sadly since it is so difficult you need so much warmup to make sure you don't injure your hands.</p>
