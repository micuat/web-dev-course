<p>The Estonian Dance Festival is one of Estonia’s most significant cultural events, held every five years in Tallinn alongside the famous Estonian Song Festival .

<h3>History</h3>
<p>The festival dates back to 1934, when the first Dance Festival was held as a complementary event to the Song Festival. Since then, it has grown into an iconic part of Estonia’s national identity, showcasing the country's deep-rooted love for folk traditions, music, and dance.</p>
<p>The event was especially important during the Soviet era, as it served as a quiet form of cultural resistance, keeping Estonian heritage alive despite foreign rule. Today, it remains a proud symbol of national unity and cultural continuity.</p>
