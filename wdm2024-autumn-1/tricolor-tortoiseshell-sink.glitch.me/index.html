              <p>
                1000$ is enough for about 3-4 road signs (with posts and
                installation by hand) so you can install a few fake one
                direction roads and it would take the city about half a year to
                notice.

                3. Ship about 10 barrels of oil to a stranger or your enemy.
              </h4>

              <p>
                The current price for a barrel of crude oil is about 80 dollars,
                so with some minimal effort you can send someone 10 barrels, or
                1200 liters of crude oil to someone's doorstep.

              <p>
                For simpler measurements let's say that 1 kilogram of salt is 1$
                and we will go all out and pour a kilogram of salt on each lawn.
                That means we are able to completely destroy about 1000 lawns
                with 1000$.

              <h4>5. Bed bugs</h4>

              <p>
                You can purchase about 500 live bedbugs with the money, and
                while I'm not sure how many houses you can infect with this, I'm
                sure it's enough. The only problem is that you will also need to
                forge documents to prove that you are a person that can actually
                be trusted with bedbugs because you will be using them for
                research purposes only.

              <p>
                If you have one already infected volunteer, you can buy about
                1800 syringes and after making all of the syringes hiv infected
                you can just go and stab people with them (not recommended)

              <p>
                1 Liter of vegetable oil is about 2.5 euros which means with
                1000$ you can buy about 400 liters of sunflower oil, which you
                can then pour anywhere you want as long as you stay secretive
                enough (people's homes? shopping centers? grocery stores? you
                name it.)
