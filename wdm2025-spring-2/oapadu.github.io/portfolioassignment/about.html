      <h2>About Me and This Website</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>I am Oskar Aleksander Padu, I play video games but also do freelance graphic design, combining both of my hobbies into something I can make money with.</h3>
      <br>
      <p>This website was made for my Website Development and Management course with Naoto Hieda,
      using principles and things I've learned in other courses like my "Front End Development" and "Web and Media" course.</p>
