<p>Cats are <strong>mysterious, fascinating, and full of surprises</strong>! Whether you're a lifelong cat lover or just curious, here are <strong>10 amazing facts</strong> about our feline friends that might surprise you. 😺</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. Most Orange Cats Are Male 🟠</h2>
<p>Did you know that <strong>about 80% of orange cats are male</strong>?</p>
<ul>
  <li>This happens because the <strong>orange (ginger) coat gene is linked to the X chromosome</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Male cats only need one orange gene</strong> to be ginger, while <strong>females need two</strong> (one from each parent).</li>
  <li>This makes orange <strong>female cats much rarer</strong> than orange males!</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>2. Tricolor Cats Are Almost Always Female 🎨</h2>
<p>Ever seen a cat with <strong>orange, black, and white fur</strong>? That’s a <strong>calico or tortoiseshell</strong>, and they are <strong>almost always female</strong>!</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is because <strong>coat color is linked to the X chromosome</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Males only have one X</strong>, so they usually don’t have enough genetic variety to be tricolored.</li>
  <li>In extremely rare cases (<strong>1 in 3,000 male cats</strong>), a <strong>male cat can be calico</strong> due to an extra chromosome (<strong>XXY syndrome</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>3. Cats Have a Secret "Third Eyelid" 👀</h2>
<p>Ever seen your cat’s eye <strong>partially covered by a thin, white layer</strong>? That’s their <strong>nictitating membrane</strong>, also called the <strong>third eyelid</strong>!</p>
<ul>
  <li>It <strong>protects and lubricates</strong> their eyes.</li>
  <li>It’s usually <strong>only visible when a cat is sick, sleepy, or waking up</strong>.</li>
  <li>If you see it often, it might mean your cat <strong>needs a vet check-up</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>4. Cats Develop a Special Language for Their Owners 🗣️</h2>
<p>Cats <strong>don’t "meow" at each other</strong> in the wild—<strong>they developed meowing just for humans!</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Adult cats mostly use body language</strong> with each other, but they <strong>meow to communicate with humans</strong>.</li>
  <li>Each cat <strong>creates a unique set of sounds</strong> that their human responds to.</li>
  <li>If your cat meows a certain way and you react, they <strong>learn to "talk" to you</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>5. Cats Can Make Over 100 Different Sounds 🎵</h2>
<p>Dogs can make <strong>around 10 distinct sounds</strong>… but cats? They can <strong>make over 100 different vocalizations!</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>They <strong>purr, trill, chirp, yowl, chatter</strong>, and of course, <strong>meow</strong>.</li>
  <li>Some breeds, like <strong>Siamese cats</strong>, are extra talkative and have <strong>a wide range of sounds</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>6. A Cat's Purr Has Healing Powers 💖</h2>
<p>Ever noticed how relaxing it is when a cat purrs? Turns out, it’s <strong>not just for comfort</strong>—it has <strong>real health benefits</strong>!</p>
<ul>
  <li>A cat’s purr <strong>vibrates at a frequency of 25-150 Hz</strong>, which is known to <strong>promote healing in bones and tissues</strong>.</li>
  <li>Studies suggest <strong>cats purr to heal themselves</strong> and <strong>even help reduce stress & anxiety</strong> in humans!</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>7. Cats Can Jump 5-6 Times Their Own Length 🚀</h2>
<p>Cats are <strong>natural acrobats</strong>! They can <strong>jump up to 5-6 times their body length</strong> in a single leap.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is thanks to their <strong>strong back legs and flexible spine</strong>.</li>
  <li>That’s why they can <strong>easily jump onto kitchen counters and bookshelves</strong>—even if we don’t want them to!</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>8. A Group of Cats is Called a "Clowder" 🐈🐈🐈</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>group of cats is called a "clowder"</strong>.</li>
  <li>A <strong>group of kittens is called a "kindle"</strong>! </li>
  <li>A <strong>male cat is a "tom"</strong>, while a <strong>female is a "queen"</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>9. Cats Can’t Taste Sweet Things 🍭</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike humans and dogs, <strong>cats lack taste receptors for sweetness</strong>!</li>
  <li>They are <strong>obligate carnivores</strong>, meaning their diet is <strong>100% meat-based</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>10. The World’s Oldest Known Pet Cat is Over 9,500 Years Old! ⏳</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>oldest evidence of a pet cat</strong> was found in <strong>Cyprus</strong>—a cat was buried alongside a human <strong>9,500 years ago</strong>!</li>
  <li>This proves that cats have been <strong>our companions since ancient times</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
