    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The objective of disc golf is simple: complete each hole in as few throws as possible. Instead of using clubs and balls, players throw specialized discs toward a target, typically a metal basket with hanging chains designed to catch the disc. Courses vary in terrain, layout, and difficulty, making each round a unique experience.</p>

<p>A typical disc golf course consists of 9 or 18 holes, each with a designated starting point (the tee pad) and a target (the basket). Players take turns throwing from the tee and then continue throwing from where their disc lands until they successfully reach the basket. Each throw counts as a stroke, and the player with the lowest number of strokes at the end of the round wins.</p>
<h2>What to expect from a typical round?</h2>
<p>A round of disc golf begins at the first tee, where players decide the order of play. Players then takes turns throwing their disc toward the target, and after all players have thrown, they proceed to where their discs landed. The player whose disc is farthest from the basket always throws next.</p>
<p>As players move through the course, they must navigate natural obstacles such as trees, elevation changes, and wind conditions, which all add to the challenge of the game. Disc selection is crucial, as different discs are designed for varying flight paths and distances. Drivers are used for long-distance throws, mid-range discs provide control and accuracy, and putters are used for lay-ups and short, precise shots into the basket.</p>
<p>The round continues in this manner until all holes are completed. Scores are recorded based on the number of throws taken on each hole, and at the end of the round, the total strokes are added up to determine the final standings.</p>
<h2>Pro Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write your phone number on your discs</strong> - Always write some kind of contact information on the underside of your discs as they often get lost on courses <strong><em>more lush with nature</em></strong></li>
<li><strong>Use a Towel</strong> ‚Äì Carry a towel with you to clean any mud, dirt, or other debris off your disc.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Form, Not Power</strong> ‚Äì Smooth, controlled throws will give you better distance and accuracy than just throwing hard.</li>
<li><strong>Choose the Right Discs</strong> ‚Äì Learn the difference between putters, mid-range discs, and drivers. Start with *understable** discs for better control as a beginner.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Relaxed and Have Fun</strong> ‚Äì Disc golf is as much about enjoying nature and socializing as it is about competition. Stay positive and keep improving!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Glossary</h4>
<p><em>understable</em> - A disc that naturally turns to the right (for a right-handed backhand throw) during its flight. Understable discs require less power to achieve distance and are great for beginners, turnover shots, and tailwind throws.</p>
