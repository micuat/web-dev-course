    <h1 class='postTitle'>To a wild rose</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>This piece I actually played in my own high school graduation. It took me about 3 months to fully learn it, from about early February 2022 to late April 2022. I don't recommend learning this piece so early in someones piano playing journey, I would recommend something a bit simpler, but if you really like this piece and strugle with motivation like me - go for it, I know how hard it can be to learn a piece if you don't even like how it sounds.
The piece is just stunningly beautiful, works really well as a performance piece and it is a good begginer piece aswell.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>&quot;To a Wild Rose&quot; is one of the most well-known and cherished piano pieces composed by Edward MacDowell in 1896. It is the first piece in his &quot;Woodland Sketches, Op. 51&quot;, a collection that reflects MacDowellâ€™s deep connection with nature and his love for the American landscape.</p>
<p>The piece is celebrated for its simplicity and lyrical beauty, evoking the image of a delicate wild rose blooming in a tranquil setting. Unlike many complex piano works, &quot;To a Wild Rose&quot; stands out for its minimalist elegance, featuring a gentle, flowing melody that seems to drift naturally, much like the unfolding of a flower. The harmony is soft and understated, allowing the melody to shine and create a sense of quiet reflection.</p>
<p>Due to its serene charm and accessibility, this piece has become a favorite for pianists of all levels and is often performed in both recitals and informal settings. Its timeless appeal lies in its ability to convey deep emotion through a simple yet exquisitely crafted musical narrative.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 9.5/10 - Absolutly gorgeous piece.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 4/10 - Quite simple, but has some challenges especially with timing.</p>
<p>Practising - 8/10 - Great piece to practice</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 8/10 - Has some repetition, which actually makes the piece harder to remeber and more boring to play. However the piece is extremly beautiful so it doesn't even matter.</p>
