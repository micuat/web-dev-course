    <h1 class='postTitle'>Nocturne in C# minor</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>One of my favorite pieces ever. What is crazy about this piece is that Chopin never actually published it himself, it was published after his death, I'm not sure why he chose to not publish it, because it is one of the greatest pieces of all time. I first learned about this piece from a movie called &quot;The Pianist&quot;. I knew that this piece was to hard for me yet I liked it so much I had to learn it instantly, even tho I was already learning a different piece at the time. Took me about 2 months (April-June 2022) to be able to play it and many-many more months to perfect it. In 2023 I performed this piece at Kullo Lastegallerii at an art exhibition rotation.</p>
<p>Some facts about this piece:<br />
This piece also saved the lives of 2 people: Natalia Karp and Władysław Szpilman, later whom also had a aforementioned feature film made about him in 2002 called &quot;The Pianist&quot;.<br />
This piece was the last thing heard on Polish radio in 1939 because the radio station was soon attacked by nazi germany.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. posth., composed by Frédéric Chopin in 1830 but published after his death, is one of his most hauntingly beautiful and emotionally intense works. Although not part of his official numbered nocturnes, it holds a special place in the repertoire due to its expressive depth and lyrical quality.</p>
<p>Written during his early years, this nocturne showcases Chopin's developing mastery of melody and harmony, with a deeply poignant, flowing right-hand melody set against a subdued, yet intricate left-hand accompaniment. The piece opens with a sorrowful, reflective theme in C-sharp minor, gradually building in intensity as it moves through its lyrical and dramatic passages.</p>
<p>A particularly striking feature is the agitato middle section, where the mood shifts to something more urgent and passionate, before returning to the calm, melancholy opening theme. The contrast between the delicate lyricism and emotional turbulence is typical of Chopin’s nocturnes, embodying the Romantic era’s focus on individual expression and deep feeling.</p>
<p>This nocturne has become a popular piece due to its emotional depth and accessibility, offering both pianists and listeners a glimpse into Chopin’s introspective and poetic soul. It’s often associated with intimate, contemplative moments, and is a favorite for those seeking to explore the quieter, more expressive side of Chopin’s music.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 10/10 - One of the if not the greatest piano piece.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 6.5/10 - Deceptively difficult, has some 2/3 cross-rythms.</p>
<p>Practising - 8.5/10 - Pretty good piece to practise, has some repetition.</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 9/10 - Very enjoyable to play and not the hardest to remeber.</p>
