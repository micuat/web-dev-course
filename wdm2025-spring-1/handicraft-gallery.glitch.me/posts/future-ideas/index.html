        <p>In this post I'm going to introduce some future project ideas I have so if you are interested keep on reading.</p>
        <h1>Shorts with half of a corset as a waistband</h1>
        <div class="columns">
          <div class="no-split">
            <p>Most of my inspiration comes from scrolling on Pinterest as did this one. I had the idea on my mind for a while. I needed more content for my portfolio when I wanted to try to get into an art school to study fashion so I drew the idea on paper in 2024. </p>
            <p>Inspired from my gender-neutral clothing collection's color scheme I plan to use blue and silver fabric. The corset part is silver with black buttons. The shorts themselves are blue with blue ruffles at the end and on top I plan to sew silver lace vertical lines on the sides. On the backside of the shorts I plan to sew two pockets</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column-image">
            <img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/77b28da4-b9f2-4c77-9127-c6408886faeb/corset-shorts0f73.jpg?v=1740740978668" alt="skecth of shorts with half of a corset as a waistband">
          </div>
        </div>
      <h1>Straight legged pants</h1>
        <div class="columns">
          <div class="no-split">
            <p>At first these pants may seem like all the other straight legged pants but what makes these unique is that the pockets are outside of the pants not inside. Usually, the pocket of regular pants (not jeans) are "hidden" on the inside and if you turn them inside out then you can see the pocket.</p>
            <p>The inspiration for this project kind of came from my mum. I was making these other pants fit me better so I had them on insideout and my mum pointed out that it looks pretty cool with the pocket on the outside. So I skecthed the idea on a paper and plan on making them. The first idea is to make the pants in a dark gray color and the pockets will be a lighter color like light gray, white or something like that.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column-image">
            <img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/77b28da4-b9f2-4c77-9127-c6408886faeb/pants10e1.jpg?v=1740741085752" alt="skecth of straight legged pants with the pockets on the outside instead of the usual pants look with the pockets on the inside">
          </div>
        </div>
      <h1>Star shaped blanket</h1>
        <div class="columns">
          <div class="no-split">
            <p> Again for this project the inspiration came from TikTok as I was scrolling away. I really like the idea of a star shaped blanket and a color changing yarn, which I already bought! Now I just have to find the time to start crocheting.</p>
