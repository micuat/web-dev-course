    <h3>Welcome to my collection of miniature soldier painting projects.</h3>
<p>Each piece is part of my creative journey, from early sketches to my first actual graffiti.</p>
<p>Every miniature below reflects the time, care, and creativity I’ve put into this hobby.</p>
<h3>💡 What Inspires Me</h3>
<p>I’m inspired by historical battles, military uniforms, and the precision of tabletop wargaming. I mainly use acrylic paints, fine detail brushes, washes, and dry brushing techniques.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates — I haven’t painted in a while, but I might return to the hobby soon ;)</p>
<h3>🪖 Projects:</h3>
<h4>Legion X Fretensis – My First Roman Soldier Project</h4>
<p>This was my first project painting Roman soldiers.</p>
<p>The miniatures are equipped with chainmail, metal armor, Montefortino and Agen-style helmets, scutum shields, and gladius swords.</p>
<p>Legion X Fretensis was originally formed by Julius Caesar in 61 BCE and became one of his most trusted legions during the Gallic Wars and Civil War. It later fought in the First Jewish–Roman War, including the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE, and built a permanent base there.</p>
<p>The name Fretensis likely comes from a naval victory near the Strait of Otranto, where the legion helped break a blockade, enabling Caesar’s forces to move to Greece.</p>
<p>This project combined both painting techniques and a deep dive into Roman military history.</p>

<h4>Painting My First Tank – M4A3 Sherman</h4>
<p>Started independently in 2024.</p>
<p>I chose the M4A3 Sherman model for its iconic role in WWII.</p>
<p>Before starting to paint, I planned the color scheme carefully instead of deciding “on the spot,” aiming for historical accuracy.</p>

<h4>Roman Legionaries – XIIII Gemina Martia Victrix</h4>
<p>This is my second project painting Roman soldiers.</p>
<p>Created independently in 2023. This project was part of my research work.</p>
<p>The miniatures are equipped with lorica segmentata armor, Gallic-style helmets, rectangular scutum shields, and Pompeii-type gladius swords.</p>
<p>The XIIII Gemina Martia Victrix Legion was one of the most feared legions of the 1st century AD. Despite a difficult start—being destroyed by the Eburones tribe in 54 BCE and suffering heavy losses fighting Germanic tribes—it was reformed and gained fame under Augustus.</p>
<p>The legion fought in Pannonia, Germany, and played a key role in the Roman conquest of Britain, including defeating the rebel queen Boudicca in 61 AD at the Battle of Watling Street, where it earned the honorary title Martia Victrix (“Mars’ Victorious”).</p>
<p>The legion was known for its loyalty to Emperor Nero and later Emperor Vespasian, participating in several major conflicts and stationed for a long time in Pannonia until its decline by the 4th century AD.</p>
