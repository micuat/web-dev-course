      <div class="text">
<p>If you are interested on starting drawing digital arts, here I can suggest to use folowing free softwares.
Some of them have an easy interface, while others have a more complex one, but the latter will have more different features.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Free drawing programs for computer</h1>
<h3>1. Krita</h3>
  <div class="illo-container">
    <img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/9ca0c5df-20a8-4e95-88a0-ea96aa232107/Krita8c0a.png?v=1741890937519" class="illustration"/>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="text">
<p><b>Krita</b> is a completely free professional drawing program that can be used to create drawings,
for templates, editing images, adding special effects and even for creating animations!
It has a flexible and user-friendly interface, with special slots for inserting customizable tools,
while leaving a comfortable space for the workspace.
There are also many built-in brushes, filters for image editing and the program is well-adapted for graphic tablet,
and it supports working with layers.</p>
</div>
<h3>2. Gimp</h3>
  <div class="illo-container">
    <img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/9ca0c5df-20a8-4e95-88a0-ea96aa232107/gimpd2e0.jpg?v=1741890926662" class="illustration"/>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="text">
  <b>GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program</b> - is a general-purpose image manipulation program for everything
from photo retouching and composition to image creation, digital painting. There are not many brushes (but there is a possibility to download tools),
but the program itself is easy to use. So it is well suited if you want to quickly edit a picture.
</div>
<h3>3. Paint.net</h3>
  <div class="illo-container">
    <img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/9ca0c5df-20a8-4e95-88a0-ea96aa232107/paint89f5.jpg?v=1741890947411" class="illustration"/>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="text">
For all the beginners and casual users, <b>Paint.net</b> is a free drawing program that offers basic drawing and photo editing tools. 
However, it is a little more complicated than GIMP, but it has more possibilities than the previous program.

<h1>Free drawing programs for android</h1>
<h3>1. Autodesk SketchBook</h3>
  <div class="illo-container">
    <img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/9ca0c5df-20a8-4e95-88a0-ea96aa232107/sketchbook3c5af.jpg?v=1741897616249" class="illustration"/>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="text">
<b>Autodesk's Android</b> app is completely free. It offers professional drawing tools for artists and is one of the most popular creative apps for Android.
It is quite a powerful app and was designed for serious artists.
This program also supports layers and is easy to sketch in, and is also easy to use.
</div>
<h3>2. MediBang</h3>
  <div class="illo-container">
    <img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/9ca0c5df-20a8-4e95-88a0-ea96aa232107/medibang772c.jpg?v=1741897606596" class="illustration"/>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="text">
<b>MediBang</b> was created specifically for drawing and creating comics. You can use it on your tablet or phone.
The program is easy to learn, but it doesn't have many brushes and can sometimes be slow.
But it has a huge advantage in the form of cloud storage, and therefore you can easily switch from work on phones,
to work from a computer (yes, this program is also available for Windows and Mac).
</div>
<h3>3. Ibis Paint X</h3>
  <div class="illo-container">
    <img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/9ca0c5df-20a8-4e95-88a0-ea96aa232107/ibis%20paint6b20.jpg?v=1741897598397" class="illustration"/>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="text">
<b>Ibis Paint</b> is a drawing app with many interesting features.
There are two different versions of this app - paid and free. They differ in that the paid version disables ads, while the free version,
unfortunately, still has it. However, after viewing it, all the same brushes are still unlocked for a long period of time.
The program itself has a lot of possibilities, and you can even create your own brushes and make animations. Personally, I prefer this program.
Because of its capabilities and intuitive interface.
