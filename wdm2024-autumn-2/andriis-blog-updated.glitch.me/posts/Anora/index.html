<h2><strong>Rating:</strong> 6/10</h2>
<h4>2024 release Anora is the Palm D’Ore winner movie by Sean Baker. It follows a story of young sex worker Ani, her life, her marriage with 21 year old son of Russian oligarch “Vanya”, and the events that follow it. It quickly became a critical success movie of the year and was recently nominated on Oscars. It raises topics of sex worker life and struggles in modern America. It was appraised mainly for the performances of actors like Mikey Madison and Yura Borisov and original screenplay.</h4>

<h4>I did not like Anora on my first watch. I was not impressed by the story a lot. Only later when I read more about the movie I decided to give it another go. And liked it second time so much more. The camera work is always motivated and the cinematography has an interesting modern A24 look, though released by Neon. And I appreciated the story of young sex worker much more on second watch. It is deeply blatant and in a way pragmatic. The relations between her and Russian oligarchs son feels extremely true.</h4>

<h4>But where this movie stands out is the performances of all of the cast. Every character is well written and every actor performs very true and subtle. Ani’s character feels motivated and the performance is high pitched, but never feels over the head. And there is a work made by Yura Borisov, that plays Russian mob low lever criminal in a very honest and fresh performance, that adds deepness and layers to his character. In general all supportive cast is well written and the actual use of Russian and Armenian native actors with respectful use of native languages feels just right for the movie.</h4>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h4>Anora is a unique and interesting release of modern cinema, that might not stay as a cultural object for too long, but feels extremely rightly made and true to itself.</h4>
