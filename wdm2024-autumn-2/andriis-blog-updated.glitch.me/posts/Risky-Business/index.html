<h2><strong>Rating:</strong> 7/10</h2>
<h4><em>Risky Business</em> is a 1983 comedy/romance criminal movie that once changes the genre of coming out of age comedies. Main hero played by Tom Cruise is an American highschooler whose parents leave him alone in a house while away. He is pranked by his friend to phone a call girl, that leads towards unexpected circumstances. Cruise was well praised for his performance. Movie itself was a commercial success and later became recognized as one of the most influential for the genre.</h4>

<h4>I was honestly surprised by this movie. The narrative that seems so simple and common for teenage comedy now turned out to be a completely different thing than I had expected. At first I did not even understand why is this a comedy as there were no many one line jokes or pranks. it rather felt like a drama or something with elements of comedy. Secondly the story turned in a completely different direction from what i expected. Story ends on the high note and I felt that I enjoyed it. Also the connection between highschool and call girl is depicted here with a very confrontational dynamics of naivety vs experience and american spirit of risk taking.</h4>
<p>.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h4>Overall, <em>Risky Business</em> is a must-watch that combines humor, drama, and a touch of nostalgia. Donâ€™t miss out on this classic!</h4>
