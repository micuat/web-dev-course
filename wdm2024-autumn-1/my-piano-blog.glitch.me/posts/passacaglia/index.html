    <h1 class='postTitle'>Passacaglia</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>I learned this piece whilst learning Chopins ballade no.1 - ballade no.1 is incredibly difficult and I just wanted some simple piece to study in between. I had heard this piece from somwhere before and I thought it would be a solid choice. It took me 2 days to learn it and was a good distraction from balladne no.1.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The Passacaglia in G minor, originally composed by George Frideric Handel as part of his Harpsichord Suite No. 7, HWV 432, was later famously arranged for violin and viola by the Norwegian composer Johan Halvorsen in 1893. This dramatic and virtuosic arrangement has since become a staple in the string repertoire, but it has also been transcribed for solo piano, showcasing its powerful structure and musical complexity.</p>
<p>A passacaglia is a form built on a repeating bass line or harmonic progression, and in Handel's original composition, the underlying theme creates a foundation over which variations are developed. Halvorsenâ€™s arrangement (and its piano transcriptions) builds upon Handel's original idea by adding intricate and highly virtuosic passages that develop the theme with increasing intensity.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 6.5/10 - Quite a beautiful piece.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 2/10 - One of the more simple pieces.</p>
<p>Practising - 3/10 - Very repetetive.</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 5/10 - Piece is very easy to remeber, but it isnt fun to play.</p>
<h4>Performance (not mine)</h4>
