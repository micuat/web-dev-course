    <h1 class='postTitle'>Nocturne op9 no2</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>This piece is one of those pieces that is in every pianists repertuar. This took me about a month to fully learn and its a fine piece, helped me to be a better player, but I don't have real emotional connection to this piece.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Composed by Frédéric Chopin in 1830-1832, the Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9 No. 2 is one of the most beloved and recognizable pieces in the piano repertoire. It is the second in a set of three nocturnes and is noted for its lyrical, song-like quality and elegant, flowing ornamentation.</p>
<p>The piece exemplifies the Romantic era's emphasis on expressiveness and emotion, with its graceful melody weaving above a gently rocking left-hand accompaniment. Chopin's use of intricate embellishments, such as trills and turns, adds to the piece’s sense of refinement and beauty. The structure is simple yet profound, with a central theme that returns throughout, developing in complexity as the piece progresses.</p>
<p>This nocturne's popularity can be attributed to its poetic atmosphere, accessibility, and the opportunity it gives pianists to showcase both expressive phrasing and delicate fingerwork. It remains a timeless example of Chopin’s genius in creating music that is as emotional as it is technically beautiful.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 6/10 - Others might think that 6 is a low rating, but I've heard it so much that it has lost its magic and I cant rate it higher.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 6/10 - Defenetly not an easy piece, but absolutly playable.</p>
<p>Practising - 8/10 - Quite fun to practise, but it is realtively long with some repetition and a lot of different note you need to memorise.</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 5/10 - Piece is long which makes it hard to remeber in its etirety and it has quite a bit of repetition which makes the piece less fun to play.</p>
