<p>During the summer I had the pleaasure to visit an alpaca farm twice - the first time was in July during the Open Farm Days 2024 and the second was a guided tour we booked with family.</p>
<h2>Alpacafarm</h2>
<p>Alpakafarm OÜ is located in Pärnu county and is home to around 2000 animals - not only alpacas but also llamas, guanacos etc.</p>
<p>Aside from animals they also have a souvenir shop, where  you can find everything alpaca-related from figurines to sweaters to yarn.</p>
<h2>My experience</h2>
<p>Both  times I went to the farm I had an amazing experince - the guides were  super cool and  all the animals had big pastures and you can tell that they  are well taken care of!</p>
<p>We also had the chance to see baby alpacas and llamas, they were so cute and soft!</p>
<p>During the first time I visited I also had the chance to take an alpaca for a short walk, which was a cool and unique experience.</p>
<h2>Would I recommend?</h2>
<p>Even though it is quite a long drive from Tallinn, I would recommend it to everyone and I definietyly plan on going there next summer as well!</p>
