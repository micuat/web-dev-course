    <p>Bonus category - dinosaurs!!!</p>
<p>Like most small boys, I loved dinosaurs. I had a bunch of dinosaur toys ranging from small figures to bigger fancier toys. Despite the fact I don't play with those anymore, I thought it would be fun to list some of my childhood favourites.</p>
<h3>Ankylosaurus</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosaurus" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a></p>
<p>My current favourite dinosaur I would say. For starters they just look very cool. I respect, that they are peaceful herbivores, yet they could shatter a T-Rex's bones. I remember having a figure of an ankylosaurus that I quite liked as well.</p>
<p>Fun fact!<br>
Their skin is covered in armour, which is believed to be bulletproof.</p>

<h3>Diplodocus</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplodocus" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a></p>
<p>The diplodocus was my favourite dinosaur, when I was little. Currently I would say I feel quite indifferent towards them. They are a herbivore and they are very distinguishable by their long tails.</p>
<p>Fun fact!<br>
They were so large they didn't have any natural enemies at the time.</p>

<h3>Iguanodon</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguanodon" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a></p>
<p>A bit dull dinosaur yet still one of my favourites as a child. I had quite a few figures of them. They were also the main characters in that one Dinosaur movie from the year 2000.</p>
<p>Fun fact!<br>
Iguanodons had five fingers on each hand, just like humans. However, their thumbs were sharp spikes used to fend off predators.</p>
