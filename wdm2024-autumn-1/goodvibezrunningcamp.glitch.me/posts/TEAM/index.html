    <h3>RAHEL</h3>
<p>As one of the head organizers of the camp, I am here to ensure that everything runs smoothly from start to finish. My role involves not only assisting with the training sessions, but also organizing all the activities, accommodation, and meals to make sure the camp is an unforgettable experience for all participants.</p>
<p>I’ve been involved in sports my entire life, primarily in tennis and running. These passions have shaped who I am today and continue to drive me to explore new challenges and opportunities. My love for travel, meeting new people, and staying active through sports has always been at the heart of my journey.</p>
<h3>ROKAS- HEAD COACH</h3>
<p>Rokas is an experienced runner and coach, with notable achievements in long-distance running. Rokas is our camp head coach, in charge of all the runs and training programs. His role is to design training sessions that help each participant improve their running performance, achieve personal goals, and enhance the quality of their workouts. With his extensive experience and passionate approach, Rokas provides expert guidance and motivation throughout the camp. Rokas is known for his dedication to helping others enhance their running skills, making him an ideal head coach for the running camp.</p>

<h3>PHYSIOTHERAPIST</h3>
<p>A physiotherapist plays a vital role in our running camp. Their mission is to help participants prevent injuries, improve running technique, and speed up recovery. Every runner's body is unique, and a personalized approach ensures you get the most out of your training experience.</p>
<h4>How can a physiotherapist help you?</h4>
<p>✅ Injury prevention – By analyzing your running technique and movement patterns, a physiotherapist can reduce the risk of injuries.</p>
<p>✅ Personalized advice – Learn how to strengthen weak areas in your body and improve flexibility for better performance.</p>
<p>✅ Recovery and muscle care – After intense training sessions, the physiotherapist provides recovery support (like massage and stretching) to keep your body in top shape.</p>
