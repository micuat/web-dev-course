    <h1 class='postTitle'>Of foreign lands and people</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>This piece is one of the many pieces I learned while I was in university and I really wanted to learn something, but I didn't have much time, so I just learned some easier pieces. This piece took me around couple of days in October 2023. A really good intermediate piece in my opinion that you wont get instantly bored of.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>&quot;Of Foreign Lands and People&quot; is the opening piece from Robert Schumann's &quot;Kinderszenen&quot; (Scenes from Childhood), Op. 15, composed in 1838. This collection of thirteen short piano pieces reflects Schumann's nostalgic and tender memories of childhood, although the pieces were written with adult reflections in mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Of Foreign Lands and People&quot; is a simple yet deeply expressive piece that evokes a sense of innocence, wonder, and imagination, as if exploring a distant, magical world through the eyes of a child. The graceful melody, played in the right hand, floats above a gentle, flowing accompaniment, capturing the dreamy atmosphere Schumann is known for.</p>
<p>This piece is widely loved for its lyrical beauty and emotional depth, despite its relative simplicity. Its timeless appeal lies in its ability to evoke a sense of wistful longing and childlike curiosity, making it a favorite in both student and professional piano repertoire. Schumannâ€™s subtle and poetic approach to melody and harmony is on full display here, making it one of his most enduring and beloved works.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 7.5/10 - A beautiful, simple, elequent and light piece.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 5/10 - This piece isn't really hard, but the left hand has a lot of positions and can be a challenge, also the intended tempo is quite fast.</p>
<p>Practising - 8/10 - This piece actually does have repetition (this piece is just 2 sections that repeat), but since it is 1-1 repetition it actually helps to really nail this piece. Another part which makes this piece fun to practise is the difference in tempo you can play this piece at - you can play this piece slowly and it sounds completly different, but also very beautiful.</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 7/10 - I'm really not sure why this piece was hard for me to remember, but playing it is fun because of the difference in sound when playing it fast or slow.</p>
