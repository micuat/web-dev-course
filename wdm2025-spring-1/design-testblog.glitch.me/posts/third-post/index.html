<p><strong>Craig Mullins</strong> is an american digital painter and concept artist, renowned for his groundbreaking work in books, video games, and films. Often hailed as a pioneer in digital painting, Mullins began creating digital art long before drawing tablets became mainstream. Born in California in 1964, he studied product design and illustration at Art Center College of Design, eventually transitioning from transportation design to a successful career in illustration and concept art.</p>

<p>Mullins' work is deeply inspired by masters like John Singer Sargent and Frank Frazetta (whom I would also like to talk about some other time), and his versatility spans across various illustration fields. He has contributed to iliterally countless conic projects, including Magic: The Gathering card illustrations, and is highly respected globally, particularly in China, where he has been invited to speak at seminars. His legacy as a visionary in the industry remains nigh unparalleled.</p>

<p>His work often features very expressive brushwork and extensive use of texture and detail which he places with great artistic intent. Mullins' compositions are very detailed and vibrant with his rich use of color and textured brushes. Many of his works are often &quot;sketchy&quot;, such that detail is placed most where the focus of the viewer is directed or according to emotion it inteds to evoke. Of course, not everything in art is intentional, (though the detail density in certain locations for example in Mullins' works certainly is) but it's oftentimes useful (or rarely even necessary) to assume intent to have productive conversations about it.</p>

<p>Mullins' technical ability is simply outstanding and how expressively he lays out the details and elements in his works makes them mesmerizing to look at. There's a good reason why he's considered one of the pioneers of digital art and his works do indeed betray that fact. Mullins' is one of many artists I look up to and am inspired by, it was hard to pick just one artist to talk about, so I picked one of the first! He still produces works regularly to this day and many of his works can be foun on his socials or on his website: <a href="https://goodbrush.com/">https://goodbrush.com/</a>.</p>
