<h2><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</h2>
<h4>Brick is a 2005 neo-noir mystery thriller that discovers a detective story of a California high school student murder. Main hero, Brendan Frye, receives a strange note that leads him to his girlfriend's dead body. Fueled by love, he steps on the way to discover the mystery of her demise and the strange “brick” - one clue he received. The film won a prize at Sundance Festival and was well received, later gaining a cult status among fans of the genre.</h4>

<h4>The most surprising part of this movie is not its intriguing detective story and thrilling performances. Its the fact that all characters are played by high school students. But their characters, performances and narrative of the story are as if taken from original detective neo-noirs of the fifties. It adds a certain charm to the story. If done wrong, it would be just a bad parody or an arthouse performance. But all tones are so well set, all dialogues are so well crafted and all shots represent the spirit of classical noir.</h4>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h4>Brick is a very unusual, but an interesting movie to watch. I would definetely recommend it</h4>
