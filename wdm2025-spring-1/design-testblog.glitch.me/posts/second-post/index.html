    <h3>This is a little collage of a couple things I've drawn</h3>
<p>Here I will share some of my recent digital sketches and works I've made.
While I'm not entirely happy with many and wish to exclude them or make changes to them, I feel it would be dishonest to do so.
Because of that I've included only the most recent and not necessarily my favorite ones of my digital sketches and works exactly as they were left to leave an impression of truthfulness.
I feel that this sense of truthfulness creates a more true (silent, albeit important) communication between the viewer and the other party.
While my drawings aren't trying to communicate much at all a lot of the time, it's still a window into my experience (or inexperience) and some sense of intent even if they're just silly doodles (which they are).
This sense of oddly close connection is scary, because having others see your faults is scary.</p>
<p>Now, I feel that I haven't written enough, so I'll now proceed to drag out this little text bubble a bit before it pops and it's over. I mean, it's not just for the sake of that alone, but also because I think it's fun to write about things you care about deeply.
Though my main motivation remains, still, making another paragraph or two, and what other way to fill a paragraph than by talking about filling a paragraph?
Pretty neat how you can communicate about communication seemingly quite easily. And while visual communication through art is more direct it can also be more difficult sometimes, especially when tackling more complex ideas such as communication of communication (if we're talking in a more abstract sense).</p>

<p>⌃Three sketches/doodles I had recently made and not finished or such, they were all born of mostly mindless doodling while relaxing and listening to music and while they may depict scenes, those scenes do not have any storyline behind them for the most part (suppose that will have to be left for the viewer to figure it out).</p>
<p>Next are two pictures I essentially made to-order for the birthdays of a couple friends, they're portraits that are loosely inspired by Disco Elysium. My friends and I decided to have these printed on a bag each and as such have the pictures physically which came out pretty neat honestly, the print was of great quality as well so I might use the same shop's services again sometime.</p>

⌃Two portraits for my friends.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely happy with these, but I'm still glad I made them and greatly enjoyed making them!</p>

<p>⌃A recent drawing of mine, a portrait of a soldier-looking character partially shrouded by smoke.
This one was inspired by some sort of costume I happened to see on Pinterest (something I often browse). The smoke &quot;frame&quot; of the image came from my decision to rotate the image late into the process and use the smoke to sort of mask the missing area that emerged from rotating the image and since it was getting quite late, I foresaw that I was done with the drawing.</p>
