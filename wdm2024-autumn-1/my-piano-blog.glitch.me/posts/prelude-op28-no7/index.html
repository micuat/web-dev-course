    <h1 class='postTitle'>Prelude op28 no7</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>I learned this piece within a few days in August 2022, I had just finished leaning Chopins Nocturne op9 no2 and I was in the middle of learning Liszt's Liebestraum no3 and with both pieces being quite difficult I wanted a small break to play something simpler. Chopins prelude op28 no7 was the perfect choice, short, simple, light and beautiful piece.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Composed by Frédéric Chopin in 1836, the Prelude in A Major, Op. 28 No. 7 is one of the shortest and most charming pieces in his famous collection of 24 Preludes. Despite lasting only about 40 seconds to a minute, it is a beautiful, joyful burst of melody that captures the essence of simplicity and elegance.</p>
<p>This prelude is characterized by a dance-like rhythm and a lilting, folk-inspired melody. Its Mazurka-like feel reflects Chopin’s deep connection to his Polish roots, as many of his shorter works carry the influence of traditional Polish dances. The right hand plays a bright, flowing tune, while the left hand provides a steady harmonic accompaniment.</p>
<p>Though short and seemingly simple, the piece requires precise rhythmic control and a delicate touch to maintain its graceful character. The Prelude in A Major stands out in Chopin's Op. 28 collection as a brief yet wonderfully expressive miniature, offering a moment of lightness amidst the more dramatic and introspective preludes.</p>
<h4>My rating</h4>
<p>Sound - 8/10 - This piece is a perfect example of Chopins brilliance, the piece is extremely short and quite simple yet it sounds absolutly wonderful.</p>
<p>Difficulty - 3/10 - Quite simple, has an odd rythm that a player can perfect after learning all the notes.</p>
<p>Practising - 10/10 - Has similarities with slight repetition, perfect piece for pianists between beginner and intermediate level.</p>
<p>Playing/Remebering - 7/10 - Short but quite simple and has some repetition so not that fun to play.</p>
