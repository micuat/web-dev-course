<h2><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</h2>
<h4>Dune:Part 2 is 2024 long awaited sequel to Dune:Part 1, and an adaptation to the title novel Dune. For many years it was believed that an adaptation of the novel is not possible, with multiple directors like David Lynch and Jodorovsky attempted to make a proper adaptation with unique looks and movie making decisions. The attempts appeared unsuccessful due to difficult original material of the book and lack of proper technology. This changed in 2021 with the release of Dune:Part 1 title. The effort came from large budget investment from co-productive studios and use of natural location shootings and implementation of some technologies like “sand screens”. Though the movie was deemed both long and lacking some important scenes form the book. As well as ending rapidly “in the middle of the story”. Dune:Part 2 was considered a much more well made and paced movie with more complete story that actually ends the story of Paul Atreides, while offering room for future sequel. With a wide and acclaimed cast of actors that include Timothy Chalamet, Zendaya, Havier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson and more it is a spectacular visual story with a wonderful score.</h4>

<h4>For me the story of Dune and its adaptation into a movie begins first with its story. As in many ways it’s an analysis on the topics of Faith, role of leader and messiah, issues of climate change, the role of woman in middle eastern culture. The author, Frank Herbert, spend a decade writing articles on middle east, so his knowledge was vast. The movie changed some of the details from the book, that in a way made the movie story better and more complex, though called for argument between fans.</h4>

<h4>Then one thing that will never stop me from adoring this movie is insane cinematography and camera work. In combination with enormous score the camera is not always active, but always captivating. In general the pacing of the movie gives the viewer a chance to just breathe the atmosphere of planet Arrakis sometimes. This is only enhanced by an amazing performance of all actors, that seemed so natural and motivated. Especially the change of performance of Timothy Chalamet, that provides a much mature and complete Paul in this movie.</h4>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h4>Dune is a great movie experience and one of my favourite movies, that will remain in my heart and one of those must see in cinema movie experiences. Some people still feel the first movie to be too long to watch this one, that a consider understandable but wrong.</h4>
