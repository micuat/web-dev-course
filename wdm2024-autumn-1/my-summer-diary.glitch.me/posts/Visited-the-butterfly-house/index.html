<p>During the Open Farm Days 2024 me and my family decided to visit Liblikamaja (Butterfly house in English), which is located near PÃ¤rnu.</p>
<h2>Butterfly house</h2>
<p>The butterfly house  is as expected a big house which is split into two - one side has all kinds of butterflies and the other has exotic birds and animals (like sugar gliders).</p>
<p>They write on their website:</p>
<p>&quot;More than 10 species of butterflies from tropical areas all over the world fly free inside our Butterfly house&quot;</p>
<h2>My experience</h2>
<p>It was quite hot outside the day we decided to visit so it was quite uncomfortable inside the house since it has a tropical climate, and there were a lot of people inside the small house at once so it was quite cramped - it was even hard to get good parking. Aside from that the butterflies were very cool and there were so many of them so it was a good experience.</p>
<h2>Do I recommend?</h2>
<p>I would definietly recommend to go there but not during an event and maybe not during a very hot day :D</p>
