<h2><strong>Rating:</strong> 7/10</h2>
<h4>Past Lives is 2023 joint production between USA and South Korea, directed by Celine Song in her full directorial debut. It follows the story of two Koreans over their lives – immigrant Nora and Korean Hae Sung. Two child hood friends, they struggle over their relationship as Nora leaves Korea only to connect years after two times – once as young adults online and years later in New York. The movie was acknowledged for the depiction of the life of Asian immigrants in Western world. It received multiple nominations in 2023. The narrative and the roles of Greta Lee and Teo Yoo were highly praised.</h4>

<h4>Past Lives is one of those movies that I personally always like. Though one of my lecturers called it an insanely Gen Z movie in which nothing much happens. It is true in a certain way as the movie is heavily dialogue oriented and in reality the pacing is slow indeed. But the connection that it allows to establish between the viewer and characters by cinematography and this slow pacing works well for me. This story is heavily based on the life of Celine Song, that also had to emigrate from Korean in a young age. That’s why the topic of immigration, that is translated by this connection between two people never romantically involved, but as if build for each other just feels right. One of the parts of the movie that moved me a lot was when They reconnect for the first time chatting via Skype for a long period of time. And Hae Sung visits Nora in New York and they both need to deal with the fact that Nora is now married.</h4>

<h4>One thing this movie does perfectly is the presence of this husband, Arthur. I think the movie could easily dip into making him the villain of the story. Though it follows the path of making him an equal part of life to main heroes, giving him agency and value. This approach felt extremely fresh and inspiring.</h4>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h4>Past lives is one piece of modern cinematography that just drives you with your story and offers a unique perspective on the life on immigrants that is worth to watch.</h4>
