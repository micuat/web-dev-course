<h2><strong>Rating:</strong> 7/10</h2>
<h4>Mulholland Drive is a 2001 neo-noir fantasy detective movie directed by David Lynch. Though originally considered as a pilot for an upcoming series, Lynch struggled to find financing for a whole season. This resulted in rewriting some of the scenes and the ending and releasing the project in a film format. The film was a box office drop, raising only 20$ million against the budget of 15$. But was considered a critical and audience success and was praised as one of the best movies of the genre ever. Viewers praise unique style, unlinear narrative and use of unique anchor objects throughout the story. In some way it was always an idea successor to Twin Peaks, another Lynch series. Mulholland Drive kickstarted the career of some actors like Naomi Watts, and is still considered as one of the most unique movies ever.</h4>

<h4>The first thing is that this movie is definitely not for everyone. I watched in first with my friend and we had completely opposite opinions after. It is absolutely weird. One of the actors stated that Davis Lynch films from his subconscious, which is maybe the best way to describe this film. Some scenes are absolutely not understandable ever after a couple watches and the twist in the end is weird, but in some way magnificently correct. There is no common opinion on the story as it was deliberate so that every viewer understood it personally. And that is the best way to understand it. The romance between Betty and Rita is magnificently honest and becomes bitter as the movie progresses. If you like this movie it will captivate you.</h4>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h4>In some way this movie is one where you should just drown in it and allow it to flow. Absolutely not for everyone, but everyone can find something for themselves in it.</h4>
