    <h4>December</h4>
<p>So, I made the phone call and managed to get an appointment at the end of the end of the week with my family physician, but the thing is I still haven‚Äôt changed it after five years living in Tallinn, so I have to travel back to my parent‚Äôs place for that, let‚Äôs see if this maybe makes me finally change my physician (I won‚Äôt).  He also made e-consultation with an orthopaedic department, yay the new physician who came after the old one retired cares, but he‚Äôs doing too much I just have cyst üôÑ</p>
<p>Turns out I was in lucky the ultrasound technician was at the local hospital the next day, I just had to go through the ER and they will take me in whenever they have time between patients. The trauma doctor at the ER after examining my leg, said that he suspects that there could be something else wrong, that it might not be the cyst. Pffffttttt what does he know.</p>
<h4>January</h4>
<p>As a result of the e-consultation I had to kick off my new year‚Äôs with an appointment with an orthopaedic surgeon, so I got to tell my story for the 500th time again and get examined my leg once again which resulted in me having to going back to the hospital the next week for an MRI scan and after that a meeting with a rehab specialist.</p>
<p>And now let‚Äôs wait for the MRI results</p>
