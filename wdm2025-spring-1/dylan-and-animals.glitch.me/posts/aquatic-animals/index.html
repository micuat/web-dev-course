    <h3>Horseshoe crab (Limulidae)</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_crab" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a></p>
<p><img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/a1b41f8a-cb3a-4623-a1cd-4df88695af21/horseshoe-crab-76324_6409161.jpg?v=1741290637401" alt="Horseshoe crab sitting on a rock"></p>
<p>The horseshoe crab is definitely one of my favourite marine animals. I grew up in Key West and horseshoe crabs were abundant there. I often used to go to the beach and play with horseshoe crabs (and other fish that I managed to catch). They are also just very cool and unique in general. They're like a prehistoric animal living today.</p>
<h5>Fun fact!</h5>
<p>Their bright blue blood has been invaluable to the medical industry and has saved many lives due to the immune cells in their blood. Unfortunately, this is quite sad as well, because they are harvested en masse for their valuable blood. Fortunately, the American horseshoe crab is not endangered. In Asia however, they are also cooked and eaten for some reason, which means the horseshoe crab species' over there are in more danger.</p>
<h3>Moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita)</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelia_aurita" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a></p>
<p><img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/a1b41f8a-cb3a-4623-a1cd-4df88695af21/jellyfish-4947329_640c438.jpg?v=1741290744175" alt="Moonjellies floating"></p>
<p>Last summer I visited the South Carolina aquarium in Charleston. The aquarium had a dark room, which held animals who prefer the dark and in that room was a small glass panel, which held the Moon jellyfish. There were a couple dozen of them in there and it was completely mesmerizing to look at. They move so gracefully and it really was one of the most beautiful things I had seen in a while. I sat there for 10 minutes and just watched them.</p>
<h5>Fun fact!</h5>
<p>When food is scarce, they can shrink to one-tenth of their size to preserve energy.</p>

<h3>Sea cucumber (Holothuroidea)</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_cucumber" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a></p>
<p>I mainly like sea cucumbers, because they are just fun and touching them is quite interesting, due to their fuzzy and slimy texture. There is a large variety of different sea cucumbers and they look quite unique. They were also a small part of my childhood, though not as much as horseshoe crabs. Also, the super cucumber is my favourite fish in Stardew Valley.</p>
<h5>Fun fact!</h5>
<p>A group of sea cucumbers is known as a pickle!</p>
