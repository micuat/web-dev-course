    <h3>What is Disco Elysium?</h3>
<p><img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/973177ac-c364-4d3d-a30c-9fc5255902e7/if-you-couldnt-customise-your-detective-which-archetype-v0-eicOp37IIYwM5MrjR73F4KnT-oTnuY2Jm4VctTz6LAU0240.webp?v=1741346080882" alt="Character archetype selection"></p>
<p><strong>Disco Elysium</strong> is a critically acclaimed role-playing game (RPG) that blends detective noir, existential philosophy, and political intrigue into a richly layered narrative experience. It follows in the downturned city of Revachol the amnesiac detective Harry Du Bois as he investigates a murder while grappling with his own fractured psyche, offering players a deeply personal and surprisingly thought-provoking journey through its unique world and characters.</p>
<p>Disco Elysium is a wonder in world-building, storytelling, and artistic expression. Among its many artistic achievements, the game's portraits are a unique and poetic aspect that enhances the experience. These portraits are not just static images; they are windows into the souls of the characters, reflecting their personalities, struggles, and the world they inhabit.</p>
<p>Disco elysium is one of my favorite games there is, and it is especially exciting to know that the game's artwork and writing was done by estonians: the main writer and director - Robert Kurvitz and the author of the artwork in the game and the game's art director - Aleksander Rostov (his pen name). But there are of course many, many more (estonians and not) who made the project come to life.</p>
<h3>&quot;The Expression&quot;ism of Disco Elysium's portraits</h3>
<p><img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/973177ac-c364-4d3d-a30c-9fc5255902e7/20191127171244_10036.jpg?v=1741345958370" alt="The Expression"></p>
<p>The portraits in Disco Elysium are strikingly expressionistic. Each face is carefully painted and captures the wear and tear of life in Revachol, the downtrodden city. Blemishes, scars, and wrinkles are not mere decorative flourishes but indicators of struggle, addiction, and survival. And then, of course, the caricatured exaggerations of feature and the bright color release the paintings from realism and make them an expression of raw emotion. This fusion of styles creates an image language that is both concrete and surreal, capturing the game's existential and narrative themes.</p>
<p>The portraits in Disco Elysium are not just graphical depictions — they are narrative tools.
This dynamic application of portraiture adds further depth to the storytelling. The player is provided with the power to read between the lines, sensing in visual language an indication of the thoughts and feelings of a character. The portraits are now the silent dialogue that adds richness to the wordless telling.</p>
<h3>The World in Their Eyes</h3>
<p><img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/973177ac-c364-4d3d-a30c-9fc5255902e7/PC%20Computer%20-%20Disco%20Elysium%20-%20Rue%20de%20Saint-Ghislained15a.png?v=1741345989650" alt="A collage of some of the portraits"></p>
<p>The portraits in Disco Elysium are not just about the characters, but also about the world they inhabit. Revachol is a  city, where hope and despair balance in opposing tension. This tension is reflected in the portraits, which often juxtapose beauty with rot.</p>
<p>Figures like the Deserter, who's portrait is haunting and melancholic, perfectly capturing his disillusionment and despair. His sunken eyes, gaunt face, and unkempt beard reflect a man who has been worn down by years of isolation and regret. The portrait exudes a sense of tragedy, as if he is a ghost of his former self. The cold, desaturated tones of the portrait emphasize his isolation and the bleakness of his existence. The deep shadows under his eyes and the hollows of his cheeks suggest exhaustion and malnutrition. His distant, unfocused gaze conveys his detachment from reality and his obsession with the past. The Deserter’s portrait is a powerful representation of the cost of revolution and the weight of failure. It serves as a reminder of the human toll of political upheaval, adding depth to the game’s exploration of ideology and history.</p>
<h5>The deserter's portrait</h5>
<p><img src="../../../cdn.glitch.global/973177ac-c364-4d3d-a30c-9fc5255902e7/Portrait_deserter5175.webp?v=1741346726899" alt="The deserter"></p>
<p>This focus on humanity is what makes the portraits work. They force us to engage with the depth of the characters, to see past the caricature and regard them as individuals with their own hopes and fears. In doing so, they make us more invested in the game and its world.</p>
<h3>Art That Speaks to the Soul</h3>
<p>In a medium too often driven by slick imagery and hectic motion, Disco Elysium shows something about the enduring strength of portraiture. It shows us that one image, if properly constructed with thought or intent, can tell us so much. And in the process, it elevates the art of the medium to unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>Disco Elysium is not merely a game — it's a work of art, one that I could talk about for hours on end. And its portraits are the an incredible example of how a work of art can take a digital experience and complement it as well as it possibly could.</p>
